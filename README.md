# Instructions

- To test consistent hashing:
  - Use "cache_client_consistent_hashing.py" as the client file
  - Use "consistent_hashing.py" as the nodering file
  - Use "cache_server.py" as the server file
  
- 
- To test rendezvous hashing:
  - Use "cache_client_rendezvous_hashing.py" as the client file
  - Use "rendezvous_hashing.py" as the nodering file
  - Use "cache_server.py" as the server file
